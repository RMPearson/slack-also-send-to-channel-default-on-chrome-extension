# Slack "Also send to #Channel" Default On Chrome Extension

When using threads in Slack you get the option to also send the message you are writing to the channel. This is a checkbox you need to tick. By default this checkbox is "off".
This plugin simply checks this checkbox, so that the new default for this option is "on".
